Fork of https://github.com/eMOElein/DynamicMusic to add my adjustable fade settings because OpenMW's default 1-second fade between tracks is too abrupt for my tastes with Scipio's MUSE music expansions. I find a fade-out of 3-5 seconds feels much smoother and more natural for exploration tracks, but I also want to keep a faster fade-out for combat tracks so the music can kick in with appropriate urgency.
